ssh-x22519
==========

The twisted Edwards curve used for ed25519 signatures is birationally
equivalent to the Montgomery curve used for x25519: it is straightforward
to map ssh-ed25519 public keys into x25519 public keys corresponding to the
same secret scalar.

This tool is a simple command-line wrapper around the high-quality Go crypto
libraries to perform this conversion.

If ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 and ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub are matching ssh-ed25519
private and public keyfiles, the outputs of

  ssh-x25519 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

and

  ssh-x25519 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

are matching 32-byte x25519 private and public keys respectively. Private
keys are cofactor multiples and invariant under RFC 7748 scalar clamping,
so are interoperable with both clamped and non-clamped key exchange.

When the supplied keyfile is encrypted, ssh-x25519 will prompt for the
passphrase in the usual way before attempting to extract the private key.


Building and installing
-----------------------

To build the ssh-x25519 binary, run 'go build' in the source tree. To
install, copy it into a directory on your path. ssh-x25519 should compile
and run on any platform with Go 1.17 or later.
